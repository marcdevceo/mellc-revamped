    title: "What Coaching Is Not",
    description:
      "While coaching provides a structured and supportive environment for growth, it's important to understand what it isn't. Coaching is not therapy. Therapy delves into past experiences and emotional healing, whereas coaching primarily focuses on the present and future to achieve specific goals. Nor is coaching consulting. Consultants are typically hired for their expertise to provide solutions and direct advice. In contrast, coaching empowers you to generate your own solutions and strategies, acting as a facilitator and guide rather than a directive authority. We don't provide the answers; we help you uncover them within yourself.",
